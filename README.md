P5=[0.2,0.3] P6=[0.25,0.5] P7=[0.24,0.1] P8=[0.3,0.2]. Perform the k-mean
clustering with initial centroids as m1=P1 =Cluster#1=C1 and
m2=P8=cluster#2=C2. Answer the following 1] Which cluster does P6
belong to? 2] What is the population of a cluster around m2? 3] What is
the updated value of m1 and m2?

15. Use the dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and contains
information about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate Titanic
ship. Use the Seaborn library to see if we can find any patterns in the data.

16. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and
contains information about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate
Titanic ship. Write a code to check how the price of the ticket (column
name: 'fare') for each passenger is distributed by plotting a histogram.
